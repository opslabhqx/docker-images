# Docker Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles for building Docker images for various tools. Each tool has its own directory, with a Dockerfile tailored for it.

The repository is configured to automatically update and rebuild Docker images using Renovate. Renovate monitors each Dockerfile and creates pull requests to update them when new versions are available.

## Cookiecutter Template

This repository uses [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for managing Docker image templates. When initializing a new Docker image, Cookiecutter will prompt for the following variables:

1. **image_name**: The name of the Docker image (e.g., `terraform`).
2. **IMAGE_NAME**: The uppercase version of the image name (e.g., `TERRAFORM`).
3. **dockerhub_username**: Your Docker Hub username (e.g., `opslabhq`).
4. **image_platforms**: The platforms to support (e.g., `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`).
5. **image_datasource**: The datasource for version updates (e.g., `https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/datasource/`).
6. **image_depname**: The dependency name for the Docker image (e.g., `hashicorp/terraform`).

To generate a new Docker image template, navigate to the root of this repository and run:

```
cookiecutter .
```

Follow the prompts to input the required information.
